		<p><span class="_czr__blue">My name is George Fomichev.</span> I am a founder of a startup. We create technologies, which, I am sure, will become in high demand in the future.  </p>
		<p>Our first task is to empower the younger generation, students and enthusiasts, with all the necessary stuff to study practical robotics.</p>
		<p>That’s why we have developed a DIY SelfieBot and opened a free access to our technologies to create an open-source community.</p>
		<p>We see robotics as a future popular trend, that’s why we want to involve in robotics as many students and enthusiasts as possible. We believe that by 2020 the robotics and loT market will become one of the most dynamic.</p>
		<p>It’s very important to involve younger generation in practical robotics learning and help them acquire knowledge and experience in this field. Unlike Lego products and other robot-toy kits, our platforms allow a wider look at various problems and solving tasks not only in the field of micro controllers programming but also in the field of design (device’s exterior), applications programming for control as well as other.</p>
		<p>Feedback from of our platforms users and their involvement in the process of our solutions improvement is very important for us. 
		A DIY SelfieBot kit will allow acquiring skills and experience in 3D modeling and 3D printing, getting experience in making circuit boards, will allow mastering basics of creating control boards and getting practical application programming skills for iOS / Android.</p>
		<p>All this is very valuable, and we hope that you will fully experience all the benefits of joining our community.</p>
		<p>Kind regards,</p>
		<p>George Fomitchev, Endurance founder.</p>
